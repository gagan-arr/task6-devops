# 🐒 Task 6 - Monkey Jungle Website (Hosted on GitHub Pages)

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project was created as part of **Task 6** to learn how to **host a static website using GitHub Pages**.  
I built a fun, jungle-themed webpage featuring a **monkey image**, styled using **HTML and CSS**.

The website demonstrates how to:
- Upload and organize files directly on GitHub
- Link external CSS to an HTML file
- Display images on a web page
- Host and publish a live static website using **GitHub Pages**

## 🚀 How I Hosted It on GitHub Pages

1. **Created a new repository** named `task-6-github-pages` on GitHub.  
2. **Added files** using GitHub’s “Add file” → “Create new file” and “Upload files” options:
   - Uploaded `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `monkey.jpg`.
3. In the repository **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Clicked **Save** and waited for 1–2 minutes.
5. GitHub automatically generated my live site link.
